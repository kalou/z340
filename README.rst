This was committed on an SFO-somewhere flight with some cached one page curses
tutorial and is an ugly piece of code.

Do not use if you're looking for python/curses examples.

This gave me a convenient toy to play with the thing, in the case it
was a homophonic substitution, which it is probably not given the time
spent on it by researchers.

If you like history mysteries and didn't hear about this one, you
definitely want to look into it.
